# L-RAM-JAPDE and H-RAM-JAPDE: Deterministic Population Size Reduction Differential Evolution Algorithms Based on RAM-JAPDE

## Abstract

—RAM-JAPDE  is  an  adaptive  differential  evolutionalgorithm  which  applies  RAM,  an  adaptive  method  that  ranksthe  individuals  of  the  population  and  keeps  a  record  of  theperformance  of  the  mutation  strategies  applied  to  each  groupcombined  with  JAPDE,  an  adaptive  method  that  adapts  F  andCR parameters jointly. This paper proposes two algorithms thatadapt PS by applying Population Size Reduction methods basedon  RAM-JAPDE.  These  algorithms  are  L-RAM-JAPDE,  thatuses  Linear  Population  Size  Reduction,  and  H-RAM-JAPDE,that   uses   Reduction   to   the   Half   Population   Size   Reduction.These  algorithms  were  evaluated  using  the  benchmark  func-tions   proposed   at   CEC2014   world   congress.   L-RAM-JAPDEand  H-RAM-JAPDE  were  compared  to  other  state-of-the-artusing  Wilconxon  statistical  tests  and  two  N  to  N  comparisonmetrics. The experimental results proves that the first approachimproves  its  precursor  and  that  both  are  competitive  or  evenoutperforms the counterparts, which indicates that other state-of-the-art algorithms could improve their performance by applyinga  population  size  reduction  method.
